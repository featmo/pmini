# pmini
Minimal personal project folder structure generator
##about
I was tired of manually creating folders and subfolders for my 3d personal projects so this is meant to alleviate the stress, in the future i would like to add true folder management. Its very rough around the edges as i took this as a chance to improve my c++ programming.

###Requirements
GCC version 9
Make 

##Building
very simple in your command line simply navigate to the **pmini** folder and type *make comp* followed by *make pmini*.
